# learn-linux-interactive-shell
Interactive shell script that teaches Linux.

The goal with this script is to give new Linux-users a guided textbook experience but in an interactive way.
Mostly focused on system administration since it covers most topics, but anything relevant is welcomed into the script.

I appriciate if people would like to contribute with content

# learn-linux-interactive-shell
Interactive shell script that teaches Linux. (Under development)

The goal with this script is to give new Linux-users a 'guided textbook experience' inside the terminal with interactive tasks.
Mainly focused on system administration tasks since it covers most topics, but anything relevant is welcomed into the script.

I appriciate if you want to contribute to make this an excellent tool!

# linux-interactive-learning
A shell script that teaches new users how to use Linux by giving interactive tasks.

The goal with this script is to give new Linux-users a 'guided textbook experience' with interactive tasks inside the terminal.
Mainly focused on system administration tasks since it covers most topics, but anything relevant is welcomed into the script.

I appriciate if you want to contribute to make this an excellent tool!

How to use:
1. Download the files.
2. Locate the folder, right-click 'main.sh', click properties and make it executeable.
3. Double click main.sh to run the program.
